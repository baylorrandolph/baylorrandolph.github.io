			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>In June 2020 I graduated from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo and earned a Bachelorâ€™s of Science in Graphic Communication with a concentration in Management and a minor in Entrepreneurship. I value personal development, quality relationships, and inner passion. I strive to be someone who is supportive, a leader, and always motivates the people around me.</p><p> 
Through my classes, I have become skilled in Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, and Photoshop. I have also become proficient in Microsoft Office applications including Word, Excel, and Powerpoint, as well as G Suite. I also know the basics of HTML and CSS coding.</p><p>
In my free time, I love to get outside and go on adventures. I love hiking, camping, yoga, and exploring new places.</p>
